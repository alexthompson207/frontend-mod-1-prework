# Next Step Plan

## What is your plan and how are you going to hold yourself to it? Specifically...

1. What are you going to work on? Resources here.

I'm going to work on:
- Review/go over Mod 1 prework, Section 1-4 and Final Project exercises
- Review Mod 1 curriculum
- Read Jon Duckett book on JavaScript
- Look at Codecademy JavaScript course
- Practice keyboard shortcuts in terminal, atom, slack, etc..
- Typing practice a least 3x a week on the Turing typing.io website
- Work on time management skills, read articles, listen to podcasts about productivity

2. What days are you going to work?

I'm going to try and aim for working 5-6 times a week. Maybe Monday-Saturday with Sundays off.

3. What times on those days are you going to work?

I like to work in the mornings, 9am to 12pm.

4. Where you going to be sitting/standing as you do this?

My desk is set up in my bedroom, I have a little table on my desk that I can use to alternate between
sitting and standing. Maybe some work at the kitchen table if my roommates aren't around.

5. Where are you documenting this plan? Google Calendar, calendar on your wall, your journal?

I will document this plan on a calendar that's currently on my wall. Still trying to figure out the best
method that works for me. I prefer written calendars to google calendars.

6. Do any stakeholders in your life know about this plan? (The answer needs to be yes by the time you answer this...)

Yes, friends and my partner know about Turing. Going to try and spend as much time with them as well as doing some
work before mod 1 starts.

7. What personal items/events are important to you during this time? How are you going to make sure those are not neglected? (Hint, block time on the calendar for them!)

My parter and dog are very important to me. I need to manage my time well, and set time aside to spend with them as well
as friends. Have already planned a whitewater rafting trip next week, and a backcountry ski trip to a yurt in March over
our Mod break. Need to set plans ahead of time for Mod breaks, maybe go home for Christmas?
